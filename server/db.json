Their local/fresh menu goes beyond delicious pizzas offering incredible appetizers, salads and desserts. With a seasonal Menu, make sure to order one or two appetizers (they WON'T disappoint). My go to’s are the Braised Short Rib, Poached Pear & Burrata, Serrano and Sausage Pizza, and the Bianco. When they ask if you want dessert… Say YES! Their Almond Cake is to die for.",

With such a small menu, you really can’t go wrong. I love their Fruta Salad as a nice palate cleanser and the steak empanadas for my entree! Be sure to try their cronut dessert… It is Bomb!",
